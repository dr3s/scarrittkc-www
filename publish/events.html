	  	<h2>Scare-it Halloween</h2>
	  	<p>
	  Get the pun… "Scarritt Neighborhood" hosts SCARE-IT Halloween?? Yes, we host a huge
	  and we mean HUGE Halloween event that brings in about 7,500 people! Our residents
	  lining Gladstone Boulevard from the Museum down to Mersington Ave, along with lots
	  of volunteers, make the night special by going ALL OUT on decorations and costumes
	  for themselves and their houses. We’ve had a 20 foot pirate ship to a "real" car
	  wreck to the full blown cast of The Wizard of Oz. We also have things like
	  inflatables, slides and obstacle coursE and moonwalks, live chalk artists, haunted
	  houses, train rides and police on horseback (always a hit)! Check out pictures at
	  David Remley’s blog <a href="http://website//hyperblogal.blogspot.com/">here</a>.
