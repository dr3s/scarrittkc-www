		  <h2>History</h2>
		  <p>The SRNA neighborhood has gone through many transitions. It is one of the oldest
		neighborhoods in Kansas City, Missouri and has roots back to the city’s founding
		in 1850. The Scarritt name derives from Rev. Nathan Scarritt, a Methodist minister
		who moved to the area during the Civil War. Rev. Scarritt’s land was near the cliffs
		overlooking the Missouri River. By 1893 the family had sold or donated a large portion
		of the land for North Terrace Park and Cliff Drive—an area with homes dating between
		1887 and 1911 and representing a wide variety of styles including Queen Anne,
		Mission, Beaux Arts, Chateauesque, Georgian Revival, Shingle, Victorian Eclectic,
		Shirtwaist and Bungalow.</p>
