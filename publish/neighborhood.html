	  <h2>Rich History</h2>
	  <p>
	  The neighborhood is located between Independence Boulevard and Cliff Drive on
	  the north to south, and between Jackson Avenue and Chestnut Trafficway on the
	  east to west. Scarritt Renaissance derives its name from Methodist minister
	  Reverend Nathan Scarritt who moved to the area during the Civil War to avoid the
	  growing hostilities of border warfare in nearby Westport . In 1886, Scarritt's
	  land, near the cliffs overlooking the Missouri River, was annexed into Kansas
	  City and he began selling parcels to be platted. By 1893, the Scarritt family
	  had sold and donated a significant portion of the lands for North Terrace Park
	  and Cliff Drive. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The majority of residential development occurred from 1887 to
	  1911. These homes embody a wide variety of architectural styles including
	  Beaux-Arts, Chateauesque, Queen Anne, Mission Style, Georgian Revival, Shingle
	  Style, and Victorian Eclectic, as well as Shirtwaist and Bungalow. The parks and
	  boulevard system was a primary motivating factor in the construction of ornate
	  mansions along Gladstone and Benton Boulevards. The area features the work of
	  many noted architects. The area is also home to the Robert A. Long Mansion , now
	  in use by the Kansas City Museum . Many of the homes are rehabilitated or in the
	  process of rehabilitation. The neighborhood is a designated historic district
	  and has an annual homes tour open to the public. Homeowners take great pride in
	  ownership here.

	  A Northeast Kansas City Historical Society was recently created to preserve our 
	  great history.  Find out more here

	  <h2>A Sense of Community</h2>
	  <p>
	   If we DO say so ourselves, Scarritt Renaissance Neighborhood Association is 
	   building on its successes and making even better things happen. Many new neighbors 
	   tell us that they’ve never lived in a place with such a strong sense of community. 
	   The Kansas City Museum of History and Science plays a huge part in this culture, 
	   with its many family friendly events, from kids workshops to outside neighborhood 
	   concerts.  Also, Northeast Arts organizes many community events, as does Don Bosco, 
	   MATTIE RHODES and the Northeast Kansas City Public Library.

	 	<h2>Kessler Park & Cliff Drive</h2>
	  	<p>
	   "Our" parks are one of our greatest assets.  We have a rock climbing face ALONG
	   Cliff Drive that climbers tell us, is the tallest face in a 3 hour radius!  Cliff
	   Drive is Kansas City’s only urban scenic byway.  It’s 4.3 miles, and it runs along
	   beautiful, wooded, high bluffs of the Missouri River. It also features a stocked
	   fishing pond and Kansas City’s most unique fountain, the Carl DiCapo Fountain
	   that’s made to look like THE natural waterfall FROM THE SPRING THAT USED TO BE IN
	   THAT LOCATION.  The drive is closed to auto traffic on the weekends, so the
	   pedestrians, bikers, disc golf players, stroller riders, etc, are SAFE FROM CAR
	   TRAFFIC. It also will be connected to the City Market via bike path thanks to a
	   recently received, very large, grant!!

	   What museum can increase attendance quarter over quarter, year over year, when the

	   with innovative walking tours, trolley tours, hard hat tours, family fun days,
