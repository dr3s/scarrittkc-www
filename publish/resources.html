	   Thanks to the help of LISC, we created the Scarritt Renaissance Urban Renewal Plan,
	   which gives us a 10 year tax abatement if you put in $5,000 improvements on your
	   home/grounds. The process is easy and streamlined.  This is of particular value
	   because KC’s property taxes will likely be increasing incrementally over the coming
	   years.
